`ZeroOneAssembly`

**ZeroOneAssembly** is a curated collection of beginner-friendly **Assembly Language** programs written specifically for the **Intel 8086 microprocessor**.  
These programs were developed during my studies in the **Microprocessor, Microcontroller, and Assembly Language** course, where I explored the fundamentals of low-level programming, hardware interaction, and processor architecture.

This repository serves as a hands-on practice hub for anyone learning Assembly programming and working with 16-bit x86 architectures.

## üéØ Project Purpose

The main goal of this project is to apply theoretical concepts from the **Microprocessor and Assembly Language** course into practical programming tasks.  
It was created for the following reasons:

- To enhance understanding of low-level machine interactions.
- To fulfill coursework and assignment requirements.
- To practice fundamental concepts of Assembly programming on Intel 8086.
- To build a personal collection of reference programs for future learning.

## üìö About This Repository

Assembly Language is critical for understanding how software interacts directly with hardware.  
In this project, you will find simple yet foundational programs that cover:

- Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Conditional logic (even/odd checking, positive/negative detection)
- Logical decision-making (finding maximum, minimum, or validating triangle sides)
- Iterative operations (summation over ranges)

Each program is carefully structured to improve understanding of:
- **Register operations**
- **Conditional jumps**
- **Loops**
- **Direct memory access**
- **8086 instruction set**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies and Tools Used

- **Processor**: Intel 8086 (16-bit microprocessor)
- **Assembler/Emulator**: [EMU8086](http://www.emu8086.com/), DOSBox, or any compatible x86 assembler
- **Language**: Assembly Language (x86 architecture)

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run or modify these Assembly programs, you need:

- A DOS emulator like **DOSBox** (for modern operating systems)
- An 8086 assembler or emulator like **EMU8086**, **TASM**, or **MASM**

### Steps to Run

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rasheduzzamanrakib/ZeroOneAssembly.git
   ```
2. **Open your preferred assembler or emulator**
3. **Load any `.asm` file** you want to run.
4. **Assemble, compile, and execute** the program.
5. View the output and modify initial values if you want to test with different inputs.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

Each `.asm` file in this repository is an individual program focusing on a specific task.  
Files are clearly named for easy understanding (e.g., `Swap 2 numbers`, `Check Even or Odd`, `Sum from 1 to 10`, etc.)

## üéØ Learning Outcomes

By exploring these programs, you will build a strong foundation in:
- Assembly syntax and structure
- Effective use of registers (AX, BX, CX, DX, etc.)
- Understanding flags and condition checking
- Basic problem-solving in Assembly Language
- Practical application of processor instructions
